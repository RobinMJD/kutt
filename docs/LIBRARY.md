# Library organization and bulk changes

Candidate release `3.2.6-sr94.6`. The roadmap remains unchecked until release,
backup/restore, deployed-image and public-route verification gates pass.

## Management

Open **Library** above the recent-links table. Tags and collections are private
named labels; a link can belong to multiple collections and have multiple tags.
They do not grant access or transfer ownership. Shared workspaces are separate
roadmap work. Search matches literal substrings in alias, target and description.
Tag and collection filters combine with AND. State distinguishes active (not
trashed), paused, unpaused and trash; unpaused does not imply an unexpired link.
The current lifecycle status remains visible on each result.

Expand **Tags, collections and saved filters** to create, rename or remove labels
and save the current search. Saved filters can be renamed, replaced with the
current selection, or removed. A referenced label cannot be removed until its
saved filter is updated/removed: deleting it must not silently broaden a query.
Names are Unicode-normalized and case-insensitively unique within each kind and
account. Limits: 80 characters/name, 100 tags, 100 collections, 50 saved filters.

Select individual links or the current page, then add/remove a label, pause,
resume, or move to trash. Selection never implicitly includes other pages. Trash
requires browser confirmation and preserves history, aliases, policies and
organization for restore. Removing a label or collection never deletes links.

## API

Routes work under `/api` and `/api/v2`; JSON requests/responses use the same
session or `X-API-Key` authentication as the existing links API.

| Method and path | Input/result | Scoped permission |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /library` | `q`, `tag`, `collection`, `state`, `page` or `saved` query; `{data,total,page,limit,filters,labels,saved_filters}` | `links:read` |
| `POST /library/labels` | `{kind:"tag"\|"collection",name}`; `{id,kind,name}` | `links:update` |
| `PATCH /library/labels/:id` | `{kind,name}`; same result | `links:update` |
| `DELETE /library/labels/:id` | 204; 409 if saved-filter reference exists | `links:update` |
| `POST /library/filters` | `{name,filters:{q,tag,collection,state}}`; `{id,name,filters}` | `links:update` |
| `PATCH /library/filters/:id` | Same input; replaces name and criteria | `links:update` |
| `DELETE /library/filters/:id` | 204 | `links:update` |
| `POST /library/bulk` | `{ids:[link UUIDs],action,label_id?}`; `{affected,action}` | `links:update`, or `links:delete` for trash |

Bulk actions: `add_label`, `remove_label`, `pause`, `resume`, `trash`. The first
two require `label_id`. Accepts 1-100 distinct UUIDs. A successful response counts
matched links, including already-applied operations; retries do not duplicate
relations or unchanged audit events. No permanent deletion or bulk restore API
is added. Existing single-link restore remains supported.

Pages contain at most 50 links, newest first. A saved-filter ID resolves only
within the authenticated account. Domain-restricted tokens see only their own
in-scope links and assigned labels; the account-wide label/filter catalogs are
omitted. Such tokens cannot manage labels/filters or load a saved filter, but
can filter in-scope links and assign an already-known owned label. Labels never
expand token domain permissions. No administrator-wide bypass exists here.
Explicit API keys never gain rights from an accompanying browser session.
The HTML library requires a session and rejects API credentials.

Mutation requests enforce same-origin browser checks. Missing/foreign objects
are never made accessible to satisfy a bulk selection. The HTML library sets
`Referrer-Policy: same-origin` so native forms retain their origin without sending
referrers to other sites. Opaque/null origins are still rejected. Missing objects
return 404 without disclosing their owner. Malformed input returns 400, conflicts
409. Bulk operations validate the entire selection and update it in one database
transaction; missing, trashed, banned, foreign or out-of-domain rows roll back
everything. Redis invalidation occurs only after commit. Audit entries record
field names rather than tag names, URLs or other private values. Responses are
`Cache-Control: no-store`.

## Migration, rollback and validation

Migration `20260914003000_library.js` adds `library_labels`,
`library_link_labels` and `library_filters` with ownership indexes, unique
constraints and cascading relations. It does not rewrite existing links, tokens,
users or secrets. User/link deletion removes corresponding organization rows;
soft-deleted links retain labels. Downgrade refuses to discard nonempty library
data. Prefer fix-forward; a backup restore must reconcile subsequent writes.
Do not downgrade below the OIDC security release to bypass session controls.

The container regression covers owner/domain/token boundaries, literal search,
Unicode collisions, saved-filter references, CSRF, forced mid-batch rollback,
restart persistence, retained policies/history and guarded downgrade. Rendered
desktop/mobile tests exercise create/assign/filter/save, selection, pause/resume,
rename and trash. Production deployment also requires an off-host restored
database migration, public WAF smoke and monitoring checks. SQLite is the
validated application database; other engines remain a separate gate.
