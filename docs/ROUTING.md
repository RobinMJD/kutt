# Ordered redirect rules

Release `.10` implementation and isolated regression/browser checks are ready.
Publication and deployment gates remain pending until recorded in the feature roadmap.

## Model

Each link may have up to 20 ordered rules. The first matching rule wins; if none
matches, the existing link destination is used. Conditions of different kinds
are ANDed. Values within a device/language/country condition are ORed. Query
conditions are all ANDed. Rules are routing preferences, never access controls.

- Device uses the existing express-useragent parser, with isbot classification
  taking priority. Values: `desktop`, `mobile`, `tablet`, `bot`, `other`.
- Language uses the highest-quality Accept-Language preference. `fr` matches
  `fr` or `fr-FR`; `fr-FR` does not match `fr-CA`. Case is normalized. Unknown
  or wildcard language does not match a language condition.
- Country uses the local geoip-lite database and the configured trusted client
  IP. It does not trust a client-supplied CF-IPCountry header. Unknown geography
  does not match; VPNs and database age can affect results. No geolocation API
  or request data is sent to a third party.
- Query keys/values are decoded with URLSearchParams and are case-sensitive.
  `present` includes empty values, `absent` excludes all occurrences, and
  `equals` matches any duplicate occurrence equal to the given literal value.
  There are no regular expressions or scripts. Query data is not forwarded.

Targets are absolute HTTP(S) URLs without embedded credentials. Destination
validation/ban checks run before saving, outside the write transaction. No
destination page is fetched. Domain bans are rechecked on matched redirects.
The original password, ban, trash, schedule and visit-cap gates still apply.
HEAD and preview do not consume quota or record analytics. Info (`+`) shows the
default target, not a list of alternate destinations. The password form carries
only the bounded original query; it does not disclose alternate targets before
the correct password is supplied. Basic authentication and password submission
use the same rule evaluation as ordinary redirects.

## UI and API

Open **Redirect rules** from a link's actions or Library. Add named rules with
typed device/language/country/query conditions, move them up/down, then save.
Test redirect evaluates the current draft without saving or following its URL.
Removing all rules restores default-only routing. Conflicting edits return an
error instead of overwriting a newer policy; reload after reviewing that error.

Personal ownership is required, including for administrators. Workspace roles
do not grant policy management. Scoped tokens retain current domain restrictions
and cannot be elevated with a browser cookie. Native pages require a session.

Both `/api/links/{uuid}` and `/api/v2/links/{uuid}` support:

| Method | Path | Permission | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/routing` | `links:read` | `revision`, ordered `rules`, `fallback` |
| PUT | `/routing` | `links:update` | Atomically replace `rules` at supplied `revision` |
| POST | `/routing/preview` | `links:read` | Evaluate saved or supplied draft rules |

```json
{
  "revision": 0,
  "rules": [{
    "name": "French mobile campaign",
    "target": "https://example.com/fr/mobile",
    "conditions": {
      "devices": ["mobile", "tablet"],
      "languages": ["fr"],
      "countries": ["FR", "BE"],
      "query": [{"key": "campaign", "op": "equals", "value": "summer"}]
    }
  }]
}
```

Preview accepts `{"context":{"device":"mobile","language":"fr-FR",
"country":"FR","query":"campaign=summer"}}` and optional `rules` for a draft.
It returns `target`, zero-based `rule_index` (null for fallback), `rule_name`,
and `preview: true`. It does not bypass availability when a recipient later
opens the actual link. Missing rule policy has revision zero; each save increments
revision, including clearing all rules. Stale revision is `409`; malformed input
is `400`; ownership/domain denial is `404` or `410`; invalid credentials are `401`.

Limits: 32 KB serialized policy, 80-character rule names, 20 values per condition
kind, 10 query conditions, 80-character query keys, 200-character query values,
2,048-character preview/redirect query, and 2,040-character targets. At least one
condition is required per rule. Save/preview application limits are 30/60 requests
per minute per path/client when enabled; existing WAF controls remain active.

## Persistence and recovery

Additive migration `20260914030000_link_routing` creates link-owned routing JSON
and optimistic revisions. It does not modify existing links or visits. Policy
and field-name-only audit history are saved in one transaction. A forced audit
failure rolls back the policy. Corrupt stored policy returns `503` rather than
silently changing the destination; the owner can replace it at its current
revision after inspection. In-flight requests may finish with their already-read
policy; later requests read current state. Existing Redis link caching is not
used for policy reads.

Downgrade refuses a populated policy table. Older releases do not evaluate these
rules: do not roll back to `.9` once rules are in use without an explicit routing
impact decision. Prefer fix-forward or the same verified compatible image.
Preserve the current database and reconcile later writes before restoring any
pre-release snapshot. SQLite backup includes rules/revisions. CSV/JSON link
transfer retains rules as `routing_rules`, revalidates destinations and requires
`links:update` in addition to `links:create` for nonempty policies. Imported
policies start at revision one; older files without rules still work. Transfer
does not replace a complete database backup.

`tests/routing.cjs` covers conditions, precedence, preview isolation, untrusted
country headers, protected links/lifecycle, scopes/ownership/CSRF, concurrent
revision conflicts, transaction rollback, restart and guarded downgrade.
`tests/browser-routing.cjs` checks desktop/mobile editing, preview, ordering,
conflict recovery and fallback. Never point disposable tests at production data.
