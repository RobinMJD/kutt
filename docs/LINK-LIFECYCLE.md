# Link lifecycle

Open a link's Edit action and use **Availability** to pause it, schedule its
start/end or cap successful redirects. Dates in this form are UTC. Empty dates
and limits mean no constraint. Saving availability does not change the target,
alias or password. The list and form show the resulting status.

## API

Both API prefixes support `PATCH /api/v2/links/:id/lifecycle`. Authenticate as
the owner with a session, legacy API key or scoped token with `links:update`.
Administrator sessions do not override ownership on this endpoint. Domain
restrictions apply. Browser cross-origin mutations are rejected.

```json
{
  "paused": false,
  "starts_at": "2027-01-01T09:00:00Z",
  "ends_at": "2027-01-31T18:00:00Z",
  "max_visits": 100
}
```

Missing fields retain their values. `paused` must be boolean; dates require an
ISO 8601 timezone, or `null` to clear. `max_visits` is an integer 1..2147483647,
or `null` for unlimited. End must be later than start. `expire_in: null` clears
the previous relative expiry; the form exposes this as Remove previous expiry.
Invalid input returns 400 and another owner's link returns 404. The same new
policy fields are accepted by link creation and included in its idempotency
fingerprint. Creation without them and existing retry keys remain compatible.

Responses include `paused`, UTC `starts_at`/`ends_at`, `max_visits`,
`redirect_count` and `lifecycle_status`. Existing `expire_in` remains supported;
both expiry constraints apply when set. Legacy edits that omit the new fields
do not reset them.

## Redirect semantics

- Start is inclusive and end/expiry exclusive, checked at request time.
- Unavailable links return 410 with a generic message, no target disclosure and
  `Cache-Control: no-store`. They do not consume quota or record visits.
- The cap counts successful GET redirects and successful protected-link password
  submissions, including bots. It is not the asynchronous human analytics count.
  HEAD, information views and unsuccessful password attempts do not consume it.
- Existing links start at zero for this counter at migration time. Lowering a cap
  below the consumed count blocks immediately; raising/clearing it reopens access.
  Pausing and resuming never reset the count.
- A single conditional database increment prevents concurrent requests exceeding
  the cap. Normal, HTTP Basic and password-form routes share this check; cached
  metadata cannot bypass current controls. Already issued redirects cannot be
  withdrawn from clients.
- Expired links remain in the database, retain their aliases and can be edited.
  The old 30-second permanent-deletion cron is removed. Manual deletion remains
  unchanged until the separate trash/history milestone.

## Deployment and recovery

Migration `20260913230000_link_lifecycle` adds columns without replacing links or
users. Back up before migration and validate restore on the candidate image.
Down migration refuses to discard configured lifecycle policies. Tests remove
policies only from disposable data before testing down/up.

**Do not run an older image on a database with lifecycle policies.** It would
ignore pause/limits and its old cron could delete expired links. Prefer fixing
forward or redeploying the same verified lifecycle-capable image. A pre-feature
image requires restoring its matching pre-upgrade backup into an isolated copy,
validating it and explicitly reconciling all later writes before cutover. Never
overwrite current production data as a shortcut; keep it quarantined for recovery.

`tests/link-lifecycle.cjs` covers validation, owner/domain boundaries, CSRF,
password paths, concurrent caps, request-time expiry, restart and retained data.
`tests/browser-lifecycle.cjs` requires Playwright, `KUTT_BROWSER_DISPOSABLE=1` and
`KUTT_TEST_URL` pointing to a fresh loopback-only instance. It refuses an already
initialized app and exercises desktop/mobile editing and redirect enforcement.
