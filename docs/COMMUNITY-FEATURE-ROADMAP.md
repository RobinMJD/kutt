# Community Features

This contribution includes C01-C21 alongside the original managed-link workflows.
This is a source and review guide, not a deployment ledger. Installation-specific
screenshots, credentials, backup identifiers and release acceptance records are
not part of this guide. See [proposal credits](UPSTREAM-PR-REVIEW.md) and the
[UI review](UI-UX-REVIEW.md) for design lineage and browser acceptance limits.

## Original Workflows Retained

The original features remain part of the same contribution: [scoped tokens and
idempotency](API-TOKENS.md), [link availability](LINK-LIFECYCLE.md),
[history/trash/restore](LINK-HISTORY.md), [stable OIDC identities](OIDC-SECURITY.md),
[Library](LIBRARY.md), [transfer](TRANSFER.md), [QR exports](QR-CODES.md),
[workspaces](WORKSPACES.md), [routing](ROUTING.md), [analytics](ANALYTICS.md),
[privacy/retention](PRIVACY.md), [webhooks](WEBHOOKS.md),
[forwarding](FORWARDING.md), [destination monitoring](DESTINATION-HEALTH.md)
and the optional [iOS Shortcut](../examples/IOS-SHORTCUT.md).
DNS ownership proof, campaign building and the existing UI/security fixes are
retained, not replaced by older upstream proposals.

## Upgrade Boundaries

- Preserve the database and original signing/encryption secret together. Review
  additive migrations and each feature's recovery notes; an older image can
  ignore new policies even when it can read the schema.
- CSP, management-host isolation, OIDC admin mapping, destination policy, TLS and
  metrics need explicit configuration. Do not enable them by assuming a test
  topology matches an existing reverse proxy or identity provider.
- Native domain-grant revocation names the recipient/domain and requires a
  read-only confirmation page followed by an origin-checked POST. Cancel does
  not mutate. Revocation permanently invalidates scoped tokens and disables
  health monitoring; regranting does not restore either automatically. API
  DELETE remains direct. Public redirects and ownership remain unchanged.
- QR uploads use canonical plain base64 in browser JSON without a data-URI
  prefix. Exact legacy PNG data URIs remain application-compatible. WAF
  acceptance must be tested without weakening policy; no deployment result is
  inferred from successful loopback tests.
- Locale changes do not translate machine values, URLs, token scopes or signed
  inputs. Custom templates retain precedence but need the documented locale,
  theme and CSP integration.

## Reproducible Gates

Use only disposable databases and synthetic accounts. Start with
[tests/README.md](../tests/README.md); the root Dockerfile builds the test image.

```sh
docker build -t kutt-test .
docker run --rm --network none --entrypoint node kutt-test tests/container-smoke.cjs
sh tests/redis-smoke.sh kutt-test
sh tests/browser-community.sh kutt-test
sh tests/search-database.sh kutt-test mysql2 tests/oidc-role-writes.cjs
sh tests/search-database.sh kutt-test pg tests/oidc-role-writes.cjs
```

The browser runner requires the documented Playwright and locked test-decoder
setup; evidence stays outside Git. CI also exercises real MySQL/PostgreSQL
search, OIDC roles and domain grants, plus real database/Redis TLS. Run the
additional alias, moderation, sorting, visit and security database fixtures
listed in the test guide when changing those boundaries. Keep the original
browser workflows, full SQLite suite and Redis restart coverage alongside the
new focused selectors. The [release workflow](../.github/workflows/fork-release.yaml)
runs the role-write regression on both real SQL engines. The full SQLite suite
also checks mapping enabled and never enabled: expiry, role loss and session
revocation between authentication and mutation must not commit link edits,
deletions or history records. Both API prefixes and edit routes are covered,
with owner, granted-domain and workspace-collaborator controls preserved.

The community browser runner covers enforced CSP, QR branding, destination
policy and edit recovery, OIDC roles, domain grants and geography. Localization,
sorting and appearance have additional dedicated matrices. Coverage includes
320/390/1440px, EN/FR/ES and both themes where applicable; it is not a claim that
every possible combination or physical browser/device was tested.

The 1,519-key catalogs retain identical key and placeholder contracts. Reviewed
copy uses formal Spanish management commands, distinguishes moderated entries
from link destinations, and explains geography percentages naturally in French
and Spanish without changing their denominator. `tests/i18n.cjs` pins these
wording and escaped-interpolation contracts; `tests/i18n-community.cjs` checks
localized JSON errors under both API prefixes and native HTML errors. The
existing moderation, sorting and geography browser suites exercise the affected rendered surfaces,
including compact confirmation text and wrapping percentage explanations.

Passing source/CI checks do not certify live DNS, TLS, WAF, IdP admission, backup
recovery, physical printing, native clipboard behavior or iPhone Shortcut
execution. Revalidate the final reconciled commit; no upstream merge or completed
production rollout is claimed here.
